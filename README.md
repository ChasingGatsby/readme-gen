# Week 9 Challenge: Readme Generator ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This week's assignment had us design an application with node that allows the user to generate a professional readme. In addition, we were tasked with installing and utilizing the inquirer package to generate a prompt that would allow us to input information that would be used to create that intended readme.

The assignment was actually pretty simple this time around. Much of the issue was working with the new syntax that comes with node. I ended up having the most trouble with importing the generateMarkdown.js module into the index.js file, which ended up being a filepath error. Once that was resolved, the rest of the project was pretty straightforward. I ended up using the writefilesync method in order to condense the execution to a single function, and utilized switch statements to handle the License section (while also allowing ease of adding more license choices in the future), so most of the work was simply recalling a few of the concepts we'd gone over the last week in class.
